        I am Sarah Guillon, 30 years old, <strong>located in Nantes.</strong> <br></br><br></br>
        I am graduated from <strong>Neoma Business School</strong> and worked 5 years in Financial Controlling. <br></br><br></br>
        In 2022, I started a new challenge, I decided to learn coding and loved it ! <br></br>
        I participated to the <strong>intensive 9-week bootcamp organized by Le Wagon Nantes.</strong><br></br> I am currently <span><strong>looking for a job of front end or full stack developer.</strong></span><br></br><br></br>
        <strong>Learning continuously</strong>,  <strong>developing my creativity</strong> and <strong>working within a team </strong>is a great source of motivation for me.<br></br><br></br>
        I am a curious person, social and well-organized. Thanks to my previous experiences, I developed my capacity for rigor, analysis and my autonomy.<br></br><br></br>
        When I'm not coding, I enjoy doing sports, going out with my friends, travelling, hiking, as well as manual and creative activities : sewing, dried flowers, macram√©...
