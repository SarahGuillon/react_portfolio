            I am Sarah Guillon, 30 years old, located in Nantes. <br></br>
            I graduated from Neoma Business School and worked 5 years in Financial Controlling. <br></br><br></br>
            In 2022, I started a new challenge, I decided to learn coding and loved it ! <br></br>
            I participated in the intensive 9-week bootcamp organized by <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/fr/nantes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Le Wagon Nantes</a>.<br></br>
            <span>I am currently looking for a front end or full stack developer job.</span><br></br><br></br>
            Learning continuously,  developing my creativity and working within a team is a great source of motivation for me.
            I am a curious, social and well-organized person. Thanks to my previous experiences, I developed my capacity of thoroughness, analysis and autonomy.<br></br><br></br>
            When I'm not learning to code, I enjoy doing sports, going out with my friends, travelling, hiking, as well as doing manual and creative activities (sewing, dried flowers...). I also volunteer in associations like La Croix Rouge and La Ressourcerie de l'Ile, in Rez√©.<br></br><br></br>
