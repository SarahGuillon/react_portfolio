        I am Sarah Guillon, 30 years old, located in Nantes. <br></br>
        I am graduated from Neoma Business School and worked 5 years in Financial Controlling. <br></br><br></br>
        In 2022, I started a new challenge, I decided to learn coding and loved it ! <br></br>
        I participated to the intensive 9-week bootcamp organized by <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/fr/nantes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Le Wagon Nantes</a>.<br></br>
        <span>I am currently looking for a job of front end or full stack developer.</span><br></br><br></br>
        Learning continuously,  developing my creativity and working within a team is a great source of motivation for me.
        I am a curious person, social and well-organized. Thanks to my previous experiences, I developed my capacity for rigor, analysis and my autonomy.<br></br><br></br>
        When I'm not learning code, I enjoy doing sports, going out with my friends, travelling, hiking, as well as manual and creative activities : sewing, dried flowers, macram√©...<br></br><br></br>
